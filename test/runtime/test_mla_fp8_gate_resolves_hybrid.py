"""The fused FP8 decode gate must resolve hybrid sub-backends.

``data_type`` sits on the full-attention sub-backend for hybrid models. The gate
used to read it off the outer backend only, so a second ``elif`` existed to
catch NoPE + fp8 configurations the gate had missed. That branch was in fact
unreachable: reaching it required the sub-backend to be fp8 *and* the outer
backend not to be, while every supported wrapper either forwards ``data_type``
or has no sub-backend at all. Resolving the sub-backend in the gate itself makes
that coverage structural rather than incidental.
